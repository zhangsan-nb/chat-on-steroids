/**
 * Reading a model-issued shell command well enough to stop punishing it for Windows.
 *
 * These are regressions for a measured problem, not hygiene. Across the 50 most recent
 * recorded sessions, 79 of 1,175 tool calls were stored as errors — and only 16 of those
 * were a build or test that genuinely failed. Nine were ripgrep reporting "no matches" or
 * being cut short by `Select-Object -First`, both of which exit 1 by design; five were
 * PowerShell handing ripgrep an unexpanded `*`; seven were git run in a folder with no
 * `.git`. The error count had stopped meaning "something went wrong".
 *
 * The dangerous failure mode for this file is the opposite of the one it fixes: a rule that
 * is too eager launders real failures into successes, or rewrites a command into one that
 * silently searches the wrong place. Every test below that asserts a *negative* is guarding
 * that edge, and matters more than the positives.
