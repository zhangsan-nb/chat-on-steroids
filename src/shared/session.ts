/**
 * Where an agent is in its life, and — for `detached` — where its *browser view* is.
 *
 * `detached` is the state that separates the two. A ChatGPT turn runs on OpenAI's servers,
 * so closing the tab of a worker that is mid-task stops nothing: its tool calls keep
 * arriving here, correlated to the same conversation by the same request id. Treating the
 * closed tab as the end of the worker was reading the browser's lifecycle as if it were the
 * turn's. A detached worker is still working, still holds its slot, still has an inbox, and
 * can still report; it only sleeps once it has also gone quiet.
 *
 * `sleeping` is the state that makes a worker reusable rather than disposable.
 *
 * A worker used to be a one-shot job: it reported, its slot was a tombstone, and the only
 * way to get more work done was another `spawn` — another ChatGPT conversation, thrown away
 * again a few minutes later. That is both what ChatGPT itself pushes back on and a waste of
 * everything the worker had already learned about the task. So the end of a worker's *turn*
 * is no longer the end of the worker: it goes to sleep in the chat it already has, keeping
 * its conversation, its transcript, its workspace and its inbox. The prime wakes it by
 * messaging it, and the app reopens that exact chat and types the message into it.
 *
 * A sleeping worker holds no slot — that is the whole point of the state — so a run can
 * accumulate more sleeping workers than `maxWorkers` while never having more than
 * `maxWorkers` of them awake at once.
 *
 * `waking` is the short window between the prime's message being accepted and the woken chat
 * proving it is running — its first tool call, or a turn that begins after the sleep. It holds
 * the slot the revival reserved, so two revivals cannot claim the same one; a revival that
 * fails puts the worker back to sleep and gives the slot back. Nothing observed from outside
 * can stop a waking worker: a settled answer or finish that arrives then is the old turn's,
 * and the wake ends only through its own proof or failure.
 *
 * `finished` and `failed` remain the two terminal states, and a worker only reaches
 * `finished` once its own chat has grown past the context ceiling: past that point there is
 * nothing left to reuse, so the next time it stops working it stops for good.
