/**
 * Reading a model-issued shell command well enough to stop punishing it for Windows.
 *
 * Four separate jobs, kept together because all four need the same small amount of
 * understanding of one command line: which program actually determined the exit status,
 * and where its arguments begin and end.
 *
 *   1. `repairPowerShellQuoting` — a bash-style backslash-quote inside a double-quoted
 *      argument does not escape anything in PowerShell; it ends the argument, and the
 *      shell then refuses the whole line without running a single statement of it. The
 *      caller's intent is recoverable when bash's rules read the line cleanly and either
 *      PowerShell cannot, or the affected argument is provably ripgrep's pattern slot. The
 *      repair is verified against PowerShell's rules before it is allowed to stand.
 *
 *   2. `nonZeroExitIsBenign` — a search that found nothing is a *result*, not a failure.
 *      `rg` documents exit 1 as "no matches"; recording that as an errored tool call made
 *      roughly one in eight recorded exec calls a lie, and a session's error count stopped
 *      meaning anything. This does not soften real failures: a build that exits 1 is still
 *      an error, and so is a search that exits 1 *while printing its own error line*.
 *
 *   3. `normalizeShellCommand` — PowerShell does not expand `*` or `?` for native programs
 *      the way a POSIX shell does, so `rg pattern *_test.go` hands ripgrep the literal
 *      asterisk and it fails with `os error 123`. The missing step is done here instead: the
 *      glob is expanded against the working directory, exactly as the shell the caller was
 *      writing for would have done, rather than costing a round trip to rediscover the
 *      platform difference.
 *
 *      It is expansion and not translation on purpose. `-g '*_test.go'` looks like the same
 *      request and is not: an expanded operand names entries of *this* directory, while `-g`
 *      is a recursive filter that also matches `sub/nested_test.go`. Returning extra matches
 *      nobody asked for is the one outcome worse than the error, because nothing downstream
 *      can tell that it happened.
 *
 *      For the same reason a glob is only ever expanded in the *first* statement of a command
 *      line. It is expanded here, before anything runs, and the shell would have expanded it
 *      at the moment that statement was reached — the same answer only while nothing has run
 *      in between. `cd sub; rg foo *.ts` would be answered from the directory rg is not going
 *      to run in, and `npm run build; rg foo *.js` from before the files existed. A glob after
 *      the first statement is left alone and gets the hint.
 *
 *      The same function also expands bash brace groups, `src/{main,test}/x`, which PowerShell
 *      has no syntax for and hands to the program as one literal name. That rewrite is textual
 *      and asks the filesystem nothing, so it carries none of the debt above and applies to
 *      every statement. It is kept deliberately narrow, because `{ … }` is also PowerShell's
 *      script-block syntax and rewriting one of those would destroy the command.
 *
 *   4. `execRecoveryHints` — for the failures that cannot be rewritten safely, say what to
 *      do next in the same result rather than leaving the model to guess.
 *
 * Everything here is advisory. Nothing rejects a command; the only two things that change
 * what runs are the narrowly-scoped glob expansion in (3) and the re-quoting in (1), each of
 * which is applied only where the alternative was a line the shell had already refused or a
 * program handed an argument no shell would have given it. A command this file does not
 * understand is passed through untouched. When in doubt it must do nothing: a wrong
 * rewrite is far worse than a missed one.

 * Getting this wrong is not a failed call, it is a changed one. A flag that consumes the

 * character and the quote after it as the end of the string, and refuses the entire line with
 * TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString. Nothing runs — not the search, and not the `git diff` two
 * statements earlier on the same line — and the model receives a parser error that never
 * mentions the escape character that caused it.
 *
 * The fix is not the obvious one. Both escapes PowerShell *does* accept make the line parse and
 * then corrupt the argument on its way to a native program. Measured on this machine, passing
 * an argument written with a doubled quote reaches the child as one argument with the quote
 * dropped and the following argument swallowed: `argc=1, arg[0]=<state === starting second>`.
 * Re-quoting with single quotes and retaining backslash-quote works for some native arguments,
 * but Windows PowerShell 5.1 can still split them when whitespace follows the embedded quote.
 * Proven ripgrep regex patterns therefore spell that quote as \x22;
 * fixed strings and PCRE quoted regions do not acquire regex escapes.
 *
 * It acts only where all three of these hold, and does nothing at all otherwise:
 *
 *   1. PowerShell either would not have reached the end of the line with its quotes closed, or
 *      the affected argument is proven to be ripgrep's search-pattern slot. The second case is
 *      needed because an even number of bash-style escaped quotes can make the line rebalance
 *      while still handing PowerShell code to its parser or corrupting the regex sent to rg.
 *   2. Reading the same line under bash's escape rules does close every quote. That is what
 *      makes the intended token boundaries knowable rather than guessed.
 *   3. The repaired line, re-scanned under PowerShell's rules, closes every quote. A rewrite is
 *      applied only after it has been proven to fix the thing it was made for.
 *
 * A body holding `$`, a backtick, or a doubled backslash is left alone even when all three
 * hold. `"$env:X\src"` wants an interpolation that single quotes would kill, and a doubled
 * backslash means one backslash to bash and two inside a single-quoted string. Either would
 * change what the program is asked, which is the one outcome worse than the error being
 * repaired.
