/**

 * Two sources feed it. The MCP server reports every tool call with the exact arguments

 *
 * Tool ownership has one path only: normalized HTTP x-request-id -> ChatGPT
 * message.metadata.request_id -> conversationId. The correlation registry records that
 * exact proof. ConversationId then maps to a session and, independently, to swarm role.
 * If the exact request cannot be proven, the call goes to Unattributed activity. No

 * The returned promise includes preparation and durable append. The dispatcher awaits it
 * for a proven caller. Unresolved identity can still need browser evidence, so that degraded
 * path releases the response and keeps this promise charged to its settling/shutdown barrier.
 *
 * Evidence windows open at admission. Calls from the same request keep their admission order,
 * and known sessions serialize preparation plus append. A late owner may append behind another
 * workflow already committed to that session: seq remains commit/cursor order, while the existing
 * turn-local chronology uses the original startedAt. Unknown identity must never reserve every
 * other session's writer merely to impose a global order that no individual chat needs.
 *
 * The unidentified path has a crash window: a call whose evidence has not
 * resolved yet exists only in memory, so a power loss inside those couple of seconds
 * loses it, where the old inline write would not have. Quitting flushes. That is the
 * whole of the tradeoff, and it is bounded by REQUEST_ID_GRACE_MS.
