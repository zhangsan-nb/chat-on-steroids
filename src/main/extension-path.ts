/**
 * Where the Chrome extension lives on this machine.
 *
 * Chrome loads an unpacked extension from a real folder, so the extension cannot live
 * inside the asar — it ships as an extraResource and is copied out verbatim by the
 * package. Development can point Chrome at the repo's own `extension/`, but a packaged
 * build first mirrors `resources/extension` into the app's stable per-user data directory.
 * That extra hop matters on Linux AppImage: `process.resourcesPath` lives in a temporary
 * mount which disappears when the app exits, while Chrome remembers the exact folder used
 * for Load unpacked. The per-user copy keeps that path stable on every desktop OS and is
 * refreshed from the package on every launch/update.
