/**
 * Service worker: the only part of the extension that talks to the app.

 * ask this worker to post observations about the page it is already reading; it
 * cannot read the token, cannot reach the app on its own (the app refuses a
 * https://chatgpt.com origin), and there is no message that makes the app touch a
 * file, run a command or change a permission.
 *
 * Discovery is a scan of five fixed loopback ports for a /hello that identifies the
 * app. Nothing is broadcast and nothing listens.
 *
 * This worker also owns the observation journal. A content script lives only as long as
 * its page: a reload, a navigation or a crash takes its memory with it, and ChatGPT
 * virtualises old turns, so what is gone is often gone for good. So a content script
 * hands an observation over immediately and the durable copy lives here, in
 * chrome.storage.session — which survives this worker being shut down (Chrome does that
 * after seconds of idling) and dies with the browser, which is the right lifetime for a
 * record the app has not accepted yet.

 * but it cannot open a tab there. Handing the URL to the operating system resolves to whichever
 * Chrome instance the platform picks, which is the one that last had focus. With two instances
 * running, the successor of a chat that had just finished in the background one was created in
 * the foreground one instead — a browser this extension was not even loaded in, so nothing ever
 * redeemed the command and the handoff died with nothing connected to it.
 *
 * Only the browser holding the home tab can put the successor in the same window, and a tab
 * this worker creates is by construction in a browser that has the extension. That is the whole
 * reason this decision lives here rather than in the app.
 *
 * The offer is spent by the app on handout, so this runs once per command; a second poll, from
 * this tab or another tab of the same chat, is never given the same id. Missing redemption
 * ends at the command deadline; it never grants another browser-opening attempt.
